#!/bin/bash
# A Bash script to extract library .so file paths from an ldd output and copy them to a target folder.
#
# Usage:
#    Copy ldd <file exe> Output to <ldd_output_file>
#   ./copy_libs.sh <ldd_output_file>
#
# The script handles two main line formats:
#   1. Lines with "=>" where the file path comes after the arrow.
#      Example: libstdc++.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 (0x...)
#   2. Lines that start with an absolute path (e.g., /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x...))
#
# Files that are not present on disk (for instance, linux-vdso.so.1 without a real path)
# are skipped.

# Target directory where all the .so files will be copied.
TARGET_DIR="/home/prtihijit/Desktop/FTS/pkg_debian/FTS/opt/FTS/lib"

# Create the target directory if it doesn't exist.
mkdir -p "$TARGET_DIR" || { echo "Error: Could not create target directory $TARGET_DIR"; exit 1; }

# Check that the user provided an ldd output file as an argument.
if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <ldd_output_file>"
